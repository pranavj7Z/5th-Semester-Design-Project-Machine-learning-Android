# 5th-Semester-Design-Project-Machine-learning-Android
An Android app which lets you draw a digit into a canvas view and it recognizes the digit.</br>
The canvas view was taken from Google's example project and i developed my own machine learning model using tensor flow and integrated it into the application for digit recognition.

##  About Android TensorFlow Machine Learning MNIST Example
* This is an example project for creating machine learning model for MNIST to detect hand written digits.
* Check [this project](https://github.com/MindorksOpenSource/AndroidTensorFlowMachineLearningExample) for building tensorFlow for Android.

# [Read this article. It describes everything about creating custom model for Android using TensorFlow.](https://blog.mindorks.com/creating-custom-model-for-android-using-tensorflow-3f963d270bfb)

### How to train model?
To create model by yourself, install TensorFlow and run python scripts like
```sh
    $ python mnist.py
```
